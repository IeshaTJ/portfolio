<p>IESHA JAMES</p>
<h1>About Me</h1>

<p2> My name is Iesha James, I am 16 years of age as well as a soon to be high school senior.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I can describe myself as a very compassionte person, I look for anyway to put a 
smile on peoples' faces. I have an ultimate life goal of being able to help others in any way that I can, so I would like
to take up the career of being a nurse or working as an humanitarian.</p2>
