  such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number</p>
<p> Python Syntax: edibles = ["taco", "spam","fries","burger"]
for food in edibles:
    if food == "spam":
        print("No more spam please!")
        break
    print("Great, delicious " + food)
else:
    print("I am so glad: No spam!")
  print("Finally, I finished") </p>
